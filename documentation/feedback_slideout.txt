All of the code for the slider is located as the last part of the main header container but because it is a fixed position it shows up 200px from the top of the page on the right side of the window.  It is a pure css solution.  It works by allowing the wrapper div #slideout to gain focus through the tabindex attribute.  When it gains focus then it slides out from the right side.  After which the user can click on the feedback button and be taken to the feedback page.

Some hurdles that had to be conquered was the fact that initially when you would click the feedback button it would steal the focus away from the #slideout div.  Thus the :focus rule no longer applied to the #slideout element and it would slide back in and not follow the link.  To stop the feedback button from stealing focus until after the the mouse click was lifted and the link was followed a target attribute was added to the link to open in a blank tab.  This fix works in Firefox, Chrome, and Safari.  IE and Opera still exhibited the stealing focus problem.  To work around this a seperate version was created just for IE and Opera.

Since it all has to be contained in a single file the IE and Opera version is dispaly:none by default.  Then there are IE conditional comments to hide #slideout and show the IE/Opera version.  Then a css rule of noindex:-o-prefix, (selector) was applied to the #slideout to hide it and #slideout2 to show it and this only works for opera.

I put my CSS directly into the header_footer file because last time our main.css did not match what was currently being used and it ended up messing up some stuff so I have put it in there so that it can just be placed into the main.css that is currently being used.  The IE conditional comments with it's style tags can not be moved to the main.css though or else it will stop working in IE.
