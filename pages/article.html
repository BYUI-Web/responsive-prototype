Darlings of the Canadian music scene, Dala are now poised to bring their fresh brand of acoustic pop music to the world. Drawing upon influences like the Beatles, Joni Mitchell, Neil Young and Bob Dylan, they write songs that are both catchy and insightful.&nbsp;</p>

Representing four countries (Japan, Canada, Belgium and the United States), they fuse over 40 years of combined performing experience into one unique six-by-6-string "phenomensemble." In a pleasantly surprising way, CGT's steel stringed-guitars blend naturally with MG3's nylon-stringed guitars, as they perform original compositions and new arrangements of progressive rock, world, jazz, and classical music.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><em>Tickets go on sale October 14. $8 for BYU-Idaho students, $16 for general public. No children under six. Classroom dress.</em></p>
