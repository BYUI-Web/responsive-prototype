	<h2 class="uppercase">Photography Guide</h2>
	<p>BYU-Idaho has always been a uniquely student-focused institution. To help convey this message, photos of bright, energetic students play a major role in the university's promotional imagery. Promotional photos should exude optimism and warmth. They should also be beautiful, professional, collegiate and spiritually appropriate.</p>
	<h4>Student-Focused Photos</h4>
	<p>Successful student-focused promotional photos highlight the educational process by showing students engaged in realistic collegiate settings.</p>
	<p class="green-text">Some examples include:</p>
	<div class="row">
		<img src="" class="col-md-6">
		<img src="" class="col-md-6">
	</div>
	<div class="row">
		<p class="col-md-6">Showing BYU-Idaho students acting for themselves rather than being acted upon.</p>
		<p class="col-md-6">Illustrating participants fully engaged in academic or student life scenarios.</p>

		<p class="col-md-6">Indicating an active faculty presence.</p>
	</div>

	<h4>Campus-Focused Photos</h4>
	<p>Use beautiful photos of the campus grounds and buildings to connect audiences with and promote the university.</p>
	<p>Including some student traffic in photography adds life and vitality. Photographing building architecture can be very effective, as can photos set in other gathering places, such as the Ricks Gardens, Spori Quad and Amphitheatre Quad.</p>

	<h4>Off-Campus Photography</h4>
	<p>When shooting photography off campus, follow the same principles as on-campus photography. While the subject matter may be different, we want to maintain the same feeling.</p>
	<p>Some examples of off-campus photography may be:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Expeditions.</li>
		<li>Internships.</li>
		<li>Online students.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h4>Model Guidelines</h4>
	<p>Seek out models who:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Adhere to the Honor Code in their personal life.</li>
		<li>Exemplify the BYU-Idaho dress and grooming standards.</li>
		<li>Highlight the diversity of our student body.</li>
	</ul>
	<p class="green-text">Each model must fill out a model release form</p>
	<a class="btn-primary btn uppercase">Download release form</a>
