<div class="col-md-9">
	<p>This social medai style guide will help create a more unified online presence for BYU-Idaho. It provides general guildelines for using social media and how to properly represent your department or program as affiliated with the university.</p>
	<p>Positively communicate or sharing information that will help others understand more about and have a better experience with BYU-Idaho.</p>
	<p>Students, staff, administrators and faculty representing the university should follow these four simple guidelines for using social media:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Be Authentic and Consistent</li>
		<li>Edify and Uplift</li>
		<li>Respect Intellectual Property</li>
		<li>Be Wise and Vigilant</li>
	</ol>
	<p class="green-text">Be Authentic and Consistent</p>
	<div>
		<img src="">
		<p>Information posted online should be as accurate, clear and concise as possible. We want others to understand who we truly are and what we represent. Information should be factual and reflect the views of the university as a whole.</p>
		<p>Approved visual elements help users recognise BYU-Idaho's official web pages, representing the university. Visual branding elements should come from University Relations or be approved by University Replations.</p>
		<p>Social Media should not replace official university webpages in both the type and amount of information shared. Social media should always include a link to the BYU-Idaho website.</p>
	</div>
	<p>
		<span class="green-text">Edify and Uplift</span><br>
		<span>We want to improve the lives and uplift those with whom we interact, especially when we do so on behalf of the university. Messages should be as informative, edifying, positive and friendly as possible. If there is a choice between a possimistic and an optimistic view for the message, always be optimistic.</span>
	</p>
	<img src="">
	<p>Sometimes messages will be largely fact based or unpopular, but they should always reflect the ideals and missing of the university.</p>
	<p>Social Media is open to the public. Messages should be carefully crafted so as to not cause confusion or misrepresentation of university and church values. Carefully consider words or phrases that may be common in the Church but may have other meanings or cause confusion to a wider audience. General Authorities, Church leaders and related topics should be shared with respect and dignity.</p>
	<p>The goal of university-related social media should be to engage, not entertain.</p>
	<p class="green-text">Respect Intellectual Property</p>
	<img src="">
	<p>We comply with all copyright laws. Moreover, we encourage the use of artwork, photos and content created by your own communicators and artists.</p>
	<p>If the intellectual property of others is used, it must be used with permission and be properly attributed. Follow the Marketing Policy 1-23 and ensure that endorsements are not implied through the use of copyrighted material.</p>
	<p class="green-text">Be Wise and Vigilant</p>
	<p>Updates, corrections and responses should be timely and proofed to avoid additional errors or misunderstandings. If information is subject to change or temporary, this should be clearly noted.</p>
	<p>University values should be presented within the proper context. Care should be take to post information that is appropriate and does not contradict university values, policies or leaders. Information also must not compromise the safety of representatives, students or other staff members. <span class="green-text">See the university online safety tips.</span></p>

	<h4>BYU-Idaho Social Media Pages</h4>
	<p>Colleges, offices and other university programs may use social media profiles to communicate with their audiences. Use the five guidelines below to create official social media for your department and/or the university.</p>
	<div class="padded-left">
		<p class="green-text">Approval Steps:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Colleges, departments, offices and programs are encouraged to determine if using social media fits in their department marketing strategy.</li>
			<li>Consult with your MARCOMM representative on effective strategies.</li>
			<li>Create your social media presence.</li>
			<li>Submit the social media web URL and the contact information of the full-time employee that will be managing the page with the social media registration form to branding@byui.edu for approval.</li>
			<li>University Relations will maintain a current list of departments and offices using social media.</li>
		</ol>
		<p class="green-text">Maintaining a Social Media Profile</p>
		<ol>
			<li>A full-time employee must be an administrator over the account or profile.</li>
			<li>The full-time employee is responsible for the account or profile and all content posted for the duration of their assignment to the profile.</li>
			<li>The full-time employee must regularly review the profile's content.</li>
			<li>Comments or content deemed inappropriate must be removed.</li>
			<li>BYU-Idaho usernames, email addresses and/or passwords should not be used to set up third-party services like a social media profile.</li>
		</ol>

		<ol>
			<li>University Relations will provide a branded template to be used in creating the profile image/avatar on social media sites.</li>
			<li>Templates are available for Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn. Templates for other sites require consultation with University Relations and/or Communication Council.</li>
		</ol>
		<p class="green-text">Linking to BYU-Idaho Website</p>
		<ol>
			<li>A social media profile should not replace your official presence on the university website. This should be made clear through profile information, description, etc.</li>
			<li>Social media must always refer users back to the university website for additional information.</li>
		</ol>
		<p class="green-text">Content Considerations</p>
		<p>Students and employees should exercise proper digital citizenship. Specific applications of the four main guidelines are as follows:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Be Authentic and Consistent - be accurate</li>
			<li>Edify and Uplift - be respectful; you are representing BYU-Idaho and, therefore by extension, the Church</li>
			<li>Be Wise and Vigilant - think before you post, be aware of liability and maintain confidentiality (FERPA and other considerations)</li>
			<li>Respect Intellectual Property - respect university time and property and don't make endorsements</li>
		</ul>

		</ul>
