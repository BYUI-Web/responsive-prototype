	<h2>Video</h2>
	<p>Video plays an important role in the BYU-Idaho brand. Videos produced for the university must appropriately represent BYU-Idaho's mission, its founding principles, and its brand.</p>
	<h3>Branding Elements</h3>
	<p>Branding elements should be treated as carefully and consistently in video as they are in print. In print applications, university brand elements are often in the header or footer. Similary in video, brand elements should appear at the beginning or end of the video.</p>
	<div class="padded-left">
		<p>
			<span class="green-text"></span><br>
			<span>Only official logos can be used in videos made for and by the university. The logo should appear on a core brand color on slates or lower thirds. See the <a href="#">Color Style Guide</a> for more information. The logo cannot be combined with any of the accent colors. The logo can be placed on a photo or video if there is sufficient contrast. See <a href="#"> Logo Style Guide</a> for minimum sizes and treatment.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
			<span class="italic">Logo vs. Signature</span><br>
			<span>If the message is specific to your department, use your department's logo signature. If there are multiple departments involved or the message is broad enough to be an institutional message for all audiences, the logo signature may be replaced with the official logo.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
			<span class="green-text">Fonts</span><br>
			<span>Type used in formal video elements like opening slates, lower thirds and closing slates, must be set in official marketing typefaces. See <a href="#">Font Style Guide</a> for more information.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
			<span class="green-text">Colors</span><br>
			<span>All of the university brand colors, accent colors, and tints are shades may be used in cideo. See <a href="#">Color Style Guide</a> for more information.</span>
		</p>
	</div>
	<h3>Formal Video Elements</h3>
	<p>There are many elements that can be included throughout a video: opening slate, slides, charts and graphs, lower thirds and a closing slate. All of these elements need to use the guidelines as seen below.</p>
	<div class="padded-left">
		<p>
			<span class="green-text">Opening Slate</span><br>
			<span>An opening slate is what introduces your video. The logo is not required on the opening slate, but can be included if desired. Remember to follow the logo color, spacing sizing guidelines.</span>
		</p>
		<div class="example-container"></div>
		<p>
			<span class="green-text">Lower Thirds</span><br>
			<span>The lower third portion of the screen is devoted to key information about the current slate.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
			<span class="italic">Sizing:</span><br>
			<span>The lower third should fill the bottom of the video and should be approximately 1920 x 275 pixels. All elements hsould be kept in the Title Safe Zone.
		</p>
		<p>
			<span class="italic">Text:</span><br>
			<span>A standard font size for the lower third is 39 points (52 pixels). Font sizes may be made larger or smaller in order to strengthen the hierarchy.</span>
		</p>
		<p>The lower third portion ofthe screen should be uncluttered and easy to read. Don't place distracting textures behind the text.</p>
		<p>When choosing color combinations for the lower thirds, limit text colors to black or white on color backgrounds. Text in BYUI Blue can be used on a white or light gray background. Avoid using accent colors for text. See <a href="#">Color Style Guide</a> for more information.</p>
		<p>For ease of reading, do not include more than two lines of information of the screen at one time. If animation is used, more information may be added.</p>
		<p>Remember the hierarchy of information found in the lower third. Make the most important information more visually important. Ways to do this include:</p>
		<div class="padded-left">
			<ul>
				<li>Font size</li>
				<li>Font weight</li>
				<li>Font color</li>
				<li>Small caps/ All caps</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<div class="information-note"><p>Applying more than two of the techniques listed above is discouraged.</p></div>
		<p>In order to preserve sub-brands, be mindful of mimicking the lower thirds of any other organizations (i.e. devotional, alumni).</p>
		<p>
			<span class="green-text">Closing Slate</span><br>
			<span>Similar to movie production studios, we treat the BYUI logo the same way. Closing slates use the white logo on a black background. The closing slate can either use your department's logo signature or the official logo depending on the intended audience or message. Alwaus end with a copyright page.</span>
		</p>
		<div class="example-container"></div>
		<p>
			<span class="italic">Copyright:</span><br>
			<span>The university is the copyright owner of works produced by and/or for the university. A copyright notice identifying Brighan Young University-Idaho as the copyright owner should be included after the closing slate.</span>
		</p>
		<p>"[[copyright]] 2015 Brighan Young University-Idaho" should be placed in the lower third of the screen using 25 pn New Gothic in white text.</p>
		<div class="example-container"></div>
		<p>The creator of the video or any elements within the video cannot be credited unless it is required by law to do so. When this is the case, the credit should be placed above the copyright notice in the same font and style. Most artists will have specific requirements on how they wish to be recognised. If they require attribution byt don't specify how, a good rule of thumb is to include the title, author, site and license if applicable.</p>
		<div class="example-container"></div>
		<p>
			<span class="italic">URLs:</span><br>
			<span>if a URL is included on the clising slate, it should be done below the logo using News Gothic Italic in white. Ensure there is adequate clear space around the logo, then choose a size that will make the URL legible.</span>
		</p>
		<div class="example-container"></div>
		<p>
			<span class="italic">Transitions:</span><br>
			<span>The closing slate requires the Official Logo in white or black, approved transitions to the closing slate logo are available.</span>
		</p>
		<a href="#" class="btn btn-primary">Download Transitions</a>
		<p>
			<span class="green-text">Thumbnails</span><br>
			<span>Thumbnail images are small snapshot images taken from a video that give an idea about what the video is about. When you are able to choose a thumbnail for your video, make sure to follow these guidelines:</span>
		</p>
		<div class="padded-left">
			<ul>
				<li>The thumbnail should communicate what the video is about.</li>
				<li>The thumbnail should compliment the content surrounding the video on the webpage.</li>
				<li>When using an image of a person from the video, make sure to choose a flattering moment.</li>
				<li>Consider whether a "play" icon might cover important information on the thumbnail.</li>
			</ul>
